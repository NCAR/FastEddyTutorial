Introduction
============

This is a tutorial designed so that a user can understand how to execute the large eddy simulation (LES) model FastEddy. Four test cases are given: a) dry neutral boundary layer, b) dry convective boundary layer, c) dry stable boundary layer, and d) a moist convective case. For each case, the user will set up the input parameter file, execute FastEddy, visualize the output using a Jupyter notebook, and perform some basic analysis of the output. All case are over zero terrain. After the tutorial, the user is expected to have basic knowledge of carryout out LES using FastEddy. Computing resources with at least four general purpose graphic processing units are recommended to carry out the test cases.
