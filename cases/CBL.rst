Dry convective boundary layer
================================

This is the convective boundary layer scenario described by Sauer and Munoz-Esparza (2020). This case represents the boundary layer conditions at the SWiFT facility near Lubbock, Texas at 4 July 2012 during the period of 18Z-20Z (12:00â€“14:00 local time), the strongest period of convection on the day.

Input parameters
----------------

* Number of grid points: :math:`[N_x,N_y,N_z]=[600,600,122]`

* Potential temperature profile:
.. math::
  \partial{\theta}/\partial z =
    \begin{cases}
      0 & \text{if $z$ $\le$ 500 m}\\
      0.004 & \text{if $z$ > 500 m}
    \end{cases}

* Top boundary condition: free slip
* Lateral boundary conditions: periodic
* Time period: 6 h

Execute FastEddy
----------------

Here we will describe how to download the FastEddy package and run the model. The package will include the executables, a script to install the executables in a directory structure, and other files such as the Jupyter notebooks.

Visualize the output
--------------------

Open the Jupyter notebook entitled "FE-TUTORIAL-analyses.ipynb" and execute it. Please ensure you create the plots exactly as shown below.

Analyze the output
------------------

* Using the XY and XZ cross sections, discuss the characteristics of the resolved turbulence.
* What is the boundary layer height in the convective case?
* Using the vertical profile plots, explain why the boundary layer is unstable.
* Other...
