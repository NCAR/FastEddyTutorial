Instructions
============

* Re-run the neutral case with :math:`[N_x,N_y,N_z]=[400,400,122]` and isotropic grid spacings of: :math:`[dx,dy,dz]=[10,10,10]`. Adjust the model time step accordingly. Re-make all plots and discuss the differences between the control case. How much longer did it take to complete the simulation? 
* Re-run the convective case with a surface heat flux of :math:`=+0.70` Km/s. Re-make all plots and discuss the differences between the control case. 
* Re-run the neutral case with :math:`z_0=0.3` m. Re-make all plots and discuss the differences between the control case. 
* Re-run the neutral case with the first order upwind advection scheme. Re-make all plots and discuss the differences between the control case. Why is the first order scheme a bad choice? 
* Re-run the stable case with a surface cooling rate of :math:`-0.5` K/h. Re-make all plots and discuss the differences between the control case. 
* Re-run the stable case using half of the GPUs used in the control simulation. How much slower does the case run?

    (Here, the user will make some modifications to the default parameters such as changing the grid spacing, stretching, model time step, advection     

    scheme,    number of grid points, domain decomposition and number of GPUs, etc, etc. Here, the user will execute the sensitivity test, and visualize 
    and analyze the     output)
