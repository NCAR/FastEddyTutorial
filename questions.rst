Comparison of the four cases
============================

(Here we can ask some questions about comparing and contrasting the results from all the cases. Some potential questions are given below...)

* What are main differences in the scale and magnitude of the resolved turbulence among the dry cases? 
* How do the statistically steady-state boundary layers differ among the dry cases?
* How does the TKE vary among the dry cases? Which case has the highest TKE and why? 
* Other...
