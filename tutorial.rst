CASE 1: NEUTRAL BOUNDARY LAYER
===============================

Background
----------

This is a canonical neutral boundary layer scenario described by Sauer and Munoz-Esparza (2020). A geostrophic wind is prescribed over ground with a set aerodynamic roughness length under a neutrally stratified boundary layer. The purpose of this test case is to visualize and analyze the resultant flow and turbulence characteristics that develop when the LES reaches statistical steady-state.

* Time scheme: 3rd order Runge Kutta
* Geostrophic wind: :math:`[U_g,V_g]=[10,0]` m/s
* Latitude: :math:`54.0` N
* Potential temperature gradients: The potential temperature is constant at 300 K from the surface to :math:`z= 500` m. Between :math:`500-650` m, the vertical gradient is :math:`0.08` K/m. Above :math:`650` m, the vertical gradient is :math:`0.003` K/m.
* Surface heat flux:  :math:`0.0` Km/s
* Surface roughness length: :math:`z_0=0.1` m
* Rayleigh damping layer: uppermost :math:`400` m of the domain
* Cell perturbations: :math:`\pm 0.25` K 
* Top boundary condition: free slip
* Lateral boundary conditions: periodic
* Time period: 2 hours
* Model time step: 0.01 s

Execute FastEddy
----------------

Here we will describe how to download the FastEddy package and run the model. The package will include the executables, a script to install the executables in a directory structure, and other files such as the Jupyter notebooks.

Visualize the output
--------------------

Open the Jupyter notebook entitled "FE-TUTORIAL-analyses.ipynb" and execute it. Please ensure you create the plots exactly as shown below.

* Geostrophic wind: :math:`[U_g,V_g]=[8,0]` m/s
* Advection scheme: Hybrid 5th-6th order, blending coefficient of 0.8
* Time scheme: 3rd order Runge Kutta
* Latitude: :math:`33.5` N
