CASE 1: DRY NEUTRAL BOUNDARY LAYER
==================================

Background
----------

This is a canonical neutral boundary layer scenario described by Sauer and Munoz-Esparza (2020). A geostrophic wind is prescribed over ground with a set aerodynamic roughness length under a neutrally stratified boundary layer. The purpose of this test case is to visualize and analyze the resultant flow and turbulence characteristics that develop when the LES reaches statistical steady-state.

SENSITIVITY TESTS
=================

(Here, the user will make some modifications to the default parameters such as changing the grid spacing, stretching, model time step, advection scheme, number of grid points, domain decomposition and number of GPUs, etc, etc. Here, the user will execute the sensitivity test, and visualize and analyze the output)

* Re-run the neutral case with :math:`[N_x,N_y,N_z]=[400,400,122]` and isotropic grid spacings of: :math:`[dx,dy,dz]=[10,10,10]`. Adjust the model time step accordingly. Re-make all plots and discuss the differences between the control case. How much faster was the simulation completed? 
* Re-run the convective case with a surface heat flux of :math:`0.70` Km/s. Re-make all plots and discuss the differences between the control case.
* Re-run the neutral case with :math:`z_0=0.3` m. Re-make all plots and discuss the differences between the control case.
* Re-run the neutral case with the first order upwind advection scheme. Re-make all plots and discuss the differences between the control case. Why is the first order scheme a bad choice?
* Re-run the stable case with a surface cooling rate of :math:`-0.5` K/h. Re-make all plots and discuss the differences between the control case.
* Re-run the stable case using 4 GPUs instead of the control simulation's 8 GPUs. How much slower does the case run?
